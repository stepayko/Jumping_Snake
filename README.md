# Jumping_Snake
"Jumping Snake" C++ game. Uses Allegro Gaming Library

This video game is based on classic snake game from a year 1977.

But my reincarnation of that game has much significant features, such as:
- the snake can move in any angle (not only Up, Down, Left and Right), because the direction is a float type variable that contains angle in radiants.
- screen borders are not walls;
- and this snake can jump over the walls, food bonuses or own body on map.

So, my game is named - Jumping Snake.

The game could be played with one or two players.

To win the game, a player/players should collect all food and bonuses on the map and don't hit the walls, own body or another player’s snake.

Each player has three control buttons, Left, Right and Jump.

The game code was written in such a way, that a user can set almost any display resolution, from 100 * 100 and up to Full HD, 4K or 8K and game will work in it, pixel in pixel. No blur or shape distortion even in not standard resolutions and screen aspect ratios. 

All ingame graphics are vector type, every element looks clear and sharp in any game resolution.
The size of the game elements also could be changed in a wide range from ten up to fifty pixels.

All game events are sounded. Game and menu have different background music.

The menu could be operated with the keyboard keys or using a mouse.

As a prize, a game winner (or winners) can see actual replay of his (their) game.

In the end of the game it is possible to replay this level again or randomly generate another level.

Ingame menu have such settings that could be changed:
-	a screen mode (full screen or window);
-	a window width and height;
-	a game difficulty (speed);
-	a unit size;
-	a background color.

Also there are “help” and “credits” screens.
